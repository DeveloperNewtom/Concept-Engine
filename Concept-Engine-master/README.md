# Concept Engine
###### An Experimental Game Engine

### Concept Engine is an experimental graphics engine that uses a 2d HTML Canvas Context to create 3d objects.
## How it Works
###### Concept Engine is an engine that doesn't use a framework to create 3d images. 3d images on a computer isn't really a 3d image, but an illusion of one created using different colored and shaded pixels to create an illusion. We used a variable called `origin`
###### Snippet of Code:
`var origin = 10;`
###### In this case, I used the number 10. Now we are going to make other variables that contain 2d coordinates and that relate to this variable. For example:
`var a = [origin, origin]`
`var b = [a[0] + 50, a[1] + 50]`
###### Then join a coordinate to its appropriate coordinate and then viola`! A 3d shape!

## Support Us!
###### We are still in beta and we still have loads to do to finish this project. The best thing is it's open source. So if you want to create any changes (good ones) or help:
